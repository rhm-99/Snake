# Snake

Having previously learnt a little bit of Python before attending university, I decided to take up the opportunity to learn from [this link](https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/) and then try to customise this snake game by myself.
This not only prepared my for basic Python skills, but also learn how to go about making a game with Pygame.
To run this game, open this project in PyCharm and run Snake.py so that the game appears. To play this game, it is the same concept as Snake the game where you can use the arrow keys to go up, down, left or right.
