# Snake
    Created by Rhiya Mehta
    
Having previously learnt a little bit of Python before attending university, I decided to take up the opportunity to learn from [this link](https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/) and then try to customise this snake game by myself.
This not only prepared my for basic Python skills, but also learn how to go about making a game with Pygame.
